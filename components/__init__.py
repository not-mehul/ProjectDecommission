"""Reusable UI building blocks for vCommander.

These wrap the styling patterns that were previously re-implemented in each
view (text fields, dropdowns, buttons, cards, banners). Every component
reads its colors/spacing/radius from `theme`, so a token change or a theme
switch propagates everywhere instead of being copy-pasted per screen.

Import from the package root:

    from components import primary_button, text_field, card, section_header
